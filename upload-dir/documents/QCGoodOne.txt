      objection. To do so, complete form MR-93.1.1-V, Notice of Objection, or write a letter to the attention of the Director of the Direction des
      oppositions. In either case, be sure to state the reasons why you disagree with the notice. Send the form or letter to one of our offices.
      You must submit your notice of objection by whichever of the following dates is more advantageous for you; 90 days after the date of this
      notice: or one year after the deadline for filing your income tax return.
      You cannot contest this notice of assessment if it was issued as a result of a decision on an objection.

      We respect and protect the confidentiality of the information you provide to us. Your tax data is stored and used only as allowed by law. In
      applying fiscal laws, the Minister of Revenue may compare the information on file with information obtained from other government
