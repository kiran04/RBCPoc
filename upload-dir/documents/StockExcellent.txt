Explanation of changes and other important information

As of the date of this notice, you have unused net capital losses from other years of $741. You can use your
unused net capital losses to reduce taxable capital gains that you report this year. If you apply this amount to
another year, you may have to recalculate your unused balance. This is because of the different capital gains
rates for those years. For more information, see Guide T4037, Capital Gains.

Our records show that you have unused limited partnership losses from other years. You can still apply
$67,568 to other years.
